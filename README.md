### HOW TO USE ###

- Add a Remote Select Box field to your section.
- Set the `data url` options with a valid url
	- This url must return an array of JSON objects
	- Those object must have a `value` and a `text` member, i.e. 
````js
[{"value":"the saved value","text":"the text the user sees"}, {...}]
````
- You can use XMLHttpRequest friendly external sources or even a frontend page as your data source.

### KNOWN LIMITATIONS ###

- When updating an entry, the value will be deleted if it can't find it in the datasource or if the datasource is broken.
- Only the value is saved, not the text.
- Only the value is displayed in the table view
